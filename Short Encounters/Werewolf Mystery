Summary - A werewolf is plaguing the town of Everwinter. The townfolk don't know what to call it but people and livestock have been going missing every full moon and a fullmoon is happening TONIGHT (we'll say they last 3 days like Buffy). 

Theme: Witchery/mystery 

Details:

    The shephard is fighting Lycanthropy and is turning into a werewolf the 3 nights of the fullmoon every month. He is aware of his condition and wants to lift the curse. He's been working secretly with the cleric to do this. When the full moon comes he takes refuge in a small cave out in the woods outside of town so he won't be discovered. Every night after he transforms into the hybrid form his primal urges takes over and he end up slaughtering nearby livestock to eat. This happens for the three nights of the fullmoon and then he goes back to his normal shephard duties. 

    There are two ways to 'end' the quest - the werewolf is killed or the curse is lifted. 

    How to lift the curse - if the players are too low a level to have the remove curse spell themselves they will require aid from the town cleric to prepare a spell like ritual. The ritual will require the cursed person's hair and some silver shavings. The shavings can be bought from the merchant (the cleric mentions it's too expensive for him) and the hair can be gotten from the shephard if they can find him (the cleric mentions the shephard has already gone to his hideout and doesn't know where it is). Once the cleric has everything he can prepare the ritual but he'll need to do it within 30 feet of the afflicted for it to take affect. If the players figure all this out quickly the shephard will be in human form and a willing subject - if not they'll need to distract the werewolf form for 5 turns while the cleric performs the ritual. (The DM can roll every turn for the cleric for dramatic effect but it will always take 5 turns. Nat 20's can make it take one less turn).

    The players need to:

        discover the quest
        determine the cause is a werewolf
        determine who the werewolf is*
        determine how to lift the curse*
        find the werewolf's lair

How the quest begins:

    Phixi the innkeeper mentions people complaning about lost livestock over the last couple of months to the players if they ask about things happening in town

    Random villagers will be overheard complaining about the Shephard missing from their usual dice game that evening (it's a full moon)

    Whomever the wandering merchant is will mention seeing a strange creature as they ventured into town during the last full moon

    The players will encounter the remains of livestock if they venture out of town on another quest. They could also accidentally stumble upon the werewolf's lair

    Baggi will have crafted a metal restraint for the cleric if asked about anything strange. 

How to determine the cause is a werewolf:

    Inspecting the dead livestock will give the players clues about the origins of the creature and allow the players to track it down to the lair if they desire

    The innkeeper mentions the dead livestock, 
    the traveling merchant can also assume the creature was hunting livestock, 
    and some townsfolk will approach the adventuruers to ask they investigate
