Servants bring in a few different dishes - roast chickens, butternut squash soup and yam souffle. There's plenty of wine and mead to go around and everyone is enjoying a pleasant meal. Before dessert comes out Elleon chimes on his glass and stands up. 

He thanks everyone for attending
Celebrating his mothers return to her childhood home
He's excited that all of them have been contributing to his vision
With the mine soon to be fully operational he's excited to announce the next stages of the Everwinter Rejuvination plan!
    The 2nd phase is to reestablish trade routes with nearby cities - Everwinter has been isolated for long enough!

Before Elleon has a chance to announce his plans the fires in the room are all extinguished

Everyone looks around expectantly but there's a shuffling of noises at the doors. There's a bang and the doors are smashed open. Through the door walks a a shuffling elven form. The cheeks are caved in and the eyes are sunken hollow glowing areas. Following the undead elf are two hulking ogre-like forms - the skin falling from their bones as they shuffle behind, each carrying a massive club.
