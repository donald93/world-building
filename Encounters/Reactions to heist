Horkin

    Catches them in the act -
        He will smile a wicked grin and attempt to cast dominate person on one non-elf target. If he fails he will shout for the guards and act as if he had been robbed (he was I guess).

    The crime goes unnoticed
        If they make it out without being seen or heard he will be angry. He will enact his plans earlier than intended and attempt to enforce martial law on the town. He'll use magic to extract information from the guards on duty that night.

        Martial Law includes:
            Publicly appearing with Elleon and Winna in chains held by Fraig to announce his take over at noon. This will be the planned time for the Hobgoblin/Orc/Goblin forces to arrive.

            The hobgoblin forces:
                The Blood Blades
                Ruthgar the Hobgoblin Warlord.

                10 Hobgoblin captains each leading a squad consisting of:
                    2 hobgoblins
                    5 orcs
                    3 goblins
                
                There are 3 unique squads, one of all hobgoblins (the elite squad), one of all orcs (the smashas), and one of all goblins (the trappers/scouts)

            Elleon's men at arms are given the choice of working for Horkin for a reduced pay

            Townsfolk are put under strict watch as to not disturb his search for the keys if he did not see who stole them. They will be brought one by one to him and questioned. He only has magic to question about 8 people per day perfectly but he'll resort to evil tactics if necessary. He'll want to question Altran first.

        If the Ginyu Force have fled with Altran before the coup occurs then the Blood Blades will be sent for them. Aralia can sending their location back to Horkin.

Altran

    Altran is excited they managed to grab the keys but he'll need to study them further. But he doesn't feel safe doing it in town so he'll want to move his tower but that takes 8 hours of concentration. He'll begin immediately unless there's a reason not to.

    It will take Altran 48 hours of study on the keys to discern how to destory them. He will also learn everything about the keys once they're together.
