Vasili introduced the idea of the fall harvest festival to the players

In Everwinter the people like to celebrate the fall festival by dressing up! The costumes are mostly religious or natural in nature. The harvest festival is a time to celebrate the coming of winter and to pay tribute to the gods and nature for their good year. Since there's no main diety worshiped in Everwinter people come dressed in all sorts of things. Some people come dressed in things in honor of traditional gods like those of the races. 

Activities at the festival:

Food and ale stalls are set up all around the town with tons of varietys to try

Arm wrestling contest:

    Need a few different people to compete against with various strength scores

Pie Eating contest

    Need a couple of people with varoius constitution scores

People can bet on the contests

Altran is in disguise checking out the festival - he's had a lot of fun with the people here and is tring to find the perfect place for his tower. 

Elleon has sponsored many events and has provided funding for one of the biggest festivals ever! He's not present though.

There's a bonfire to end the festival.

There are three...mysterious looking figures who kind of resemble the Blood Blades. They turn out to just be fans and dressed up like them for the festival.
