The first night the party is south of the city they will be stalked by the werewolf pack.

There are two werewolves and a weretiger in the pack. 

The pack has been displaced from their usual hunting grounds in the eastern forest due to conflicts with a newly moved in spider family. Competing for food had been difficult and they lost a few members engaging with the nest, so they left.

They're hungry and looking for food

Their main motivation is survival, but they're not illogical.

Through high persuasion roles and using some creative logic the party may be able to get the pack to leave. But the party is a juicy target and could feed the pack for days.
