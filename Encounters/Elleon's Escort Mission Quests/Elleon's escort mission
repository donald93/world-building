x - what happened to merchant

Winna's caravan has a broken wheel and they can't move until things are fixed or another solution is found.
She's accompanied by 6 well armored guards and her driver - Frederick, a young human man
The wagon is pulled by two massive oxen
Inside the wagon is basically a small living space for herself with places to sit, a small bed, and a metal stove. All the materials that make up the wagon are of the highest grade. There's also perishables for the journey stored in the wagon.
She supplies her men with high grade tents and fine meals, she tries to do some of the cooking every day.

When they arrive back in town:
Winna rewards the group with some Bracers of Defense for their work
Altran is gone - he told Phixi to tell the GF that he was heading west and that he had sensed a portal
Fenwyn, Numira's contact is at the inn. She's on a contract, a big one (5k), to murder Horkin Applegrove
    - she has insider information on the layout of the mansion and Horkin's schedule
    - She received the contract through her usual source at the Sinya Family a few weeks ago but wasn't allowed to ask questions
    - She's willing to split the money with Numira, and only Numira if she's willing to help
Elleon will be inviting the GF to the mansion as an additional reward for escorting his mother into town
