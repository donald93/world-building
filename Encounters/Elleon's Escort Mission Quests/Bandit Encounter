Perception checks to see how far away the party notices the bandit blockade
    They'll either see it with time to prepare or they'll be surprised and come up to it with bandits already aware

You come to a part of the road that narrows as the forest presses up on either side. In front of you is a makeshit barricade made of logs lashed together. The logs are stacked high, too high for any of you to see over. As you approach a figure appears atop the logs. A gnome peers down at you from the logs

-Bandit leader
    "Oye, what are you all doing here? Move along, I don't want trouble"
    If they talk for a while he'll eventually notice they have nice looking weapons and armor on them and try to attack
    His name is Graver
    He's here inspecting these logs. *wink* He'll be removing them when the rest of his crew shows up with their tools.
    He'd like the party to move along in case these lashings come undone and hurt somebody, these logs sure are dangerous
    He's looking to lay a trap for any travelers coming by, a wagon would have no way to get around this blockage

Two of the bandits will be position on the logs and using ranged attacks, two others are positioned to the sides. The logs will give cover to the bandits on top and they will scurry around the logs to avoid being in line of sight with the party
