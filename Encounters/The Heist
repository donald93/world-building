        Sleep of Ages Trap
        XGE
        p114
        Simple trap (level 11â€“16, deadly threat)

        When a sleep of ages trap activates, a pressure plate unleashes a spell that threatens to send intruders into a deep slumber. The dungeon's guardians can then more easily dispose of the sleepers.
        Trigger.

        Stepping on the pressure plate triggers this trap.
        Effect.

        When activated, this trap casts a sleep spell centered on the pressure plate, using a 9th-level spell slot.
        Countermeasures.

        A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals the pressure plate. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check made within 5 feet of the pressure plate disables the trap, and a check with a total of 7 or lower triggers it. A successful dispel magic (DC 16) cast on the pressure plate destroys the trap.
