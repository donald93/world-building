Elleon will pay them the 500 gold when they return

He only enquires about the mapping of the mine and if there was any silver veins spotted

He asks them to take a bit of time off and treat themselves. They've been busy

The bloodblades should still be out for like 2ish days? on their mission

~Townsfolk 
- Info about air plane - far to the west past the farms there's a place that's so flat you can see for miles in all directions. No one lives out that far, the soil is bad so no farmers will work it. However, the occasional traveler has told a story about witnessing the clouds themselves descend upon the earth in great wind storms. These tales keep normal folk away - no one knows anyone who lives out there.

- Info about the water plane - the greatest nearby water source is Kostha Merna (dwarven for lake). It's to the north surrounded by some mountains. No one from Everwinter has ventured that far North, but the water from that lake flows south into the nearby forest and is the primary water source for the entire area. It is known that the mountainous region surrounding the lake is usually snowy and cold. The adventurers should be prepared to face dangerous conditions.

- Info about the fire plane - no one has any idea where such a thing could exist. A source of great fire? They haven't heard of anything like that.


~Elleon 

- Pays 500 gold
- Asks about the silver in the mine
- Elleon mentions that he'll prepare Captain Grano based on the information provided to him in this meeting
- He mentions that miners have already arrived and are ready to be put to work
- Oblivious to oddities, doesn't know about the convergence
- Wants the Ginyu Force to take a few days off. They've done well and he'll call for them when they're needed next


~Horkin

- Around when Elleon is paying the Ginyu Force
- Joins the conversation if the odditites/convergence are mentioned in their conversation with Elleon

~Baggi

- Excited about making some new armor for Numira
- Will inquire about Thildus if he's not Around
- If Thildus is around she'll approach him directly, wants to take him out for dinner
    - Dinner at the inn. Phixi prepared a special spot, an outdoor table lit with candles for two
    - Over the course of the meal Phixi will bring a few courses
        - Tea for Thildus, mead for Baggi
        - Freshly baked bread
        - Twixi's special stew
        - Steak
        - Chocolate pudding
    - Baggi wants to learn more about Thildus, where he's from, his family, his goals
    (her answers - human father, injured, took over the forge from him. She's from here, always lived in Everwinter, she'd like to expand the forge one day)
- Baggi will leave Thildus with a kiss if he is nice, or tough, preferrably both
- She'll leave him without a kiss if he's an asshole or too awkward

~Altran

- Has finally moved his tower into Everwinter
- Wants to meet with the Ginyu Force but it very busy diving into books and research
    - Storefront is transformed to be mostly a library
    - He explains the elemental planes
        - Everything in the universe exists on some plane of existance. There are many - too many to discuss now. We inhabit the material plane, a plane of balance containing pieces of all the surrounding planes. Immediately surrounding us are the elemental planes: earth, water, fire, and air. These planes are the source of their respective elements. Their are other planes as well, but they're not as immediately accessible or as near to the material plane. Crossover between our plane and the elemental planes is not uncommon, but a portal of the scale you witnessed is quite rare.
    - He's found a lot of info about the portals but hasn't narrowed down their exact origins. 
        - Every millenium an elemental convergence can occur. These portals are just the beginning, but they must be closed! If the portals remain open long enough the elemental planes can eventually collide with this plane and cause absolute chaos. The earth portal is closed for now, but it may be reopened if the convergence continues.
    - The portals appear in locations that exemplify those planes - like finding the earth plane portal deep underground. He suspects the Ginyu Force may need to seek out the air, fire, and water portals and close them in order to prevent the convergence. If Everwinter is at the center of this convergence, which he suspects it is, the other portals must be close by, possibly within a few days travel. He's not entirely aware of the geography in this area but people around town may be able to give the adventurers a better idea.
    - He's also read about some myterious 'keys'. He's not quite sure what that's about yet but they're often mentioned in parallel with the convergence.

~Milldrop's dream
As you drift off to sleep you experience a dream.

You see your lucky coin surrounded in total blackness. It flips towards you growing in size and flipping faster and faster, shining a radiant yellow. It encapsulates your entire vision. 

Suddenly the coin is replaced with an image. You see yourself standing in apparent victory. You're flanked by 7 others, it's hard to make them out as the forms constantly shift and change into different shapes and sizes. You hold your coin in your hand, a smile is on your face, and your leg is propped up, Captain Morgan style, on the head of a dragon. As you flip your coin the scar on your chest bursts forth in a radiant yellow light and you suddenly feel at peace.

Then the coin comes back into view, the victorious image fades.

The coin flips rapidly, this time a low purple glow surrounds the coin. 

Your vision is suddenly filled with fire. You're in the town square of Everwinter and the Inn is ablaze. People around you are screaming for help but you're fozen in place. You look up to your right and where you expect to see Elleon's mansion on its hill you see nothing. The hill is gone. A great roar fills your head and you grasp at your ears to deafen it. You bend down in pain and see Thildus at your feet. His armor is battered and broken. Next to him lies Fraig, of the Bloodblades. Thildus's sword is lodged in his chest. Thildus stirs, he reaches for you with a broken fist. Before his eyes go dark he utters, "It's not your fault."

The coin comes back into view. The flipping slows and you can make out the details of the faces. The symbols on the coin have been replaced with your own face. One one side the coin is perfectly presented, it shines as brightly as ever. You glow in the coin. The reverse is scratched and worn. You can hardly make out the feature of your face, your mustache is faded. 

You wake in a cold sweat, your heart is racing.

~Wandering druid - Henry

Tall, older human male. Wrinkles in his face. Wears only a basic loin cloth. Carries a walking stick and a small bag.

Depending on which place the party will travel to first they will encounter a druid. He'll claim he's investigating natural phenomen at either place (the tornados or this, according to him, mysterious lake). He'd like to join the party if possible. He looks to Greta for support as another keeper of nature. He'd like to train with her to help strengthen their bond with nature.

He will ultimately betray the party in order to further the convergence. This man is a crazy radical who believes the material plane should be replace by pure elemental plane.

~ Unruly inn patrons

- During Thildus' date (if that happens) the rest of the party will deal with some unrul inn patrons.
- Some new miners that Elleon has hired are too drunk and cause a commotion in the inn during dinner
    - Harras Phixi, sing incredibly loudly, break a few glasses, whatever it takes to get the rest of the parties attention
- Eventually Phixi will ask for help if the party doesn't attempt to calm them down themselves
- The miners should think logically, but slowly and drunk. It may be difficult to convince them to shut up and be quiet but maybe giving them something else to do will distract them for a while?
    - Perhaps they will say the'll leave if the party can beat them at dice poker? but they'll have to put up 50 gold as compensation if they lose
    - If they lose they may try to get physical, could be calmed or convinced to simply arm wrestle
- For helping the Party will receive drinks from Phixi and an inside scoop on what's happening outside (if Thildus is still on a date)
    - Otherwise she'll give more details about her sister's love affair
        Twixi has been seeing that man of hers more and more often. His name is Harry. This morning I caught her coming home early when I was opening the inn ;). But I'm so proud of her. She finally found someone who adores her as much as I do! He comes in every so often just to say hi, sneak a kiss, and I don't even mind because he'll help out around the inn just to be around her! It's sometimes a little TOO adorable....ah, love, such a wonderful thing.
