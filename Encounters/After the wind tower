After the wind tower

Mildrop is scryed on again in the morning

The hobgoblin force is growing stronger in the Gnoll camp

If mildrop is scryed then Horkin meets the party outside of town with the Hobgoblin crew
He will attempt to charm mildrop to retrieve the wind plane key
He will not engage himself - he wants others to do his bidding. He'll invis and peace out whent things get weird

Horkin's plans - 
Sezyryn has summoned his worshippers from beyond the mountains to Everwinter. Everwinter is the sacred place of his birth and his followers view this as a pilgrimage to their master's land. Horkin will use these troops to commence a take over of the town to prepare for his ceremony to enhance his power to its true state. The takeover will automatically commence in a few days but he'll start earlier if he is able to get the wind plane key. At that point he would have revealed his true form.

Altran's knowledge on the key-
These keys leave their creator's mark on them, he can discern a great deal. This key must have been created during the last convergence...they are containment devices of a sort? But imperfect in their construction...that must be why these portals were still appearing. He's able to 'activate' they key to enter the partial planar shifted state the GF saw at the tower. And show how easy they are to turn off/on. He hypothesizes that if all 4 keys were brought together they could essentially achieve the convergence he described...and create a point in space that exists within the 4 elemental plane and the material plane. Such an event would create an unimaginable amount of energy. 
Can it be destroyed? Potentially...they'd need to find a great source of power in order to destroy them. Destroying them would also rerelease the chaotic energies they hold and the more natural convergence could still happen - although at a much slower rate.

Going to need Horkin's spell list and character sheet in both forms

How do all the other characters react to things at this point? Should the revenant come back to fuck things up?
