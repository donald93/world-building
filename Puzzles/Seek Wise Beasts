~Stone plate with poem or something that describes wisdom, but it ends with Seek the Wise Beast. It needs to very accurately describe the wisdom stat to help point at the right beast

~After reading the plate glowing spirits appear of the following beasts:
  A Polar Bear
  A Mammoth
  An Eagle
  A Giant Boar
  A Giant Centipede
  
  The Eagle has the highest wisdom score
  
  When a spirit is touched/attacked/whatever all the spirits vanish. If the adventurers were right then the door opens. If they were wrong they will fight a group of the chosen beast
