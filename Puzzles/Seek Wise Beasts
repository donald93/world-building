The path in front of you ends suddenly at the entrance to a cavern formed out of rocks jutting out of the ground. As you get closer you can see a bright white wall of light lines the entrance to the cavern. You can't make out anything beyond the light. To the right of the entrance there is a small, stone table, like a lectern. There appear to be words carved into the table.


It is not intellect that allows you to survive in the natural kingdom
Nor is it brute strength
Perceptiveness and instinct are what keep you alive
To be intune with the surrounding world 
To understand your place
And to be strong in your own identity
That is what wisdom is

Seek the wise beast

~After reading the plate glowing spirits appear of the following beasts:
  A Polar Bear
  A Mammoth
  An Eagle
  A Giant Boar
  A Giant Centipede
  
  The Eagle has the highest wisdom score
  
  When a spirit is touched/attacked/whatever all the spirits vanish. If the adventurers were right then the door opens. If they were wrong they will fight a group of the chosen beast

*Investigation will reveal an arrow sticking out of the rock directly behind the eagle spirit
*Nature check will reveal information about each of the beasts

Once the magical barrier is gone you can see that the cavern is actually quite shallow. The back wall is a spiral pattern of rock that appears to have formed the cavern itself. At it's center is a large empty space, about as big as two fists.

*survival checks can show that others have been here within a few weeks
