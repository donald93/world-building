You exit the keep onto a small balcony carved into the side of a cliff. There are stairs down to your right. In front of you is a spectacular view. A great lake nestled in the mountains. A small island in the middle glows faintly in the evening light. Henry's eyes are alight with wonder...for a moment. Then his knows turns up at the smell that hits you all. The lake lets off a putrid smell and part of it appears to be brown rather than the crisp blue of the rest.
