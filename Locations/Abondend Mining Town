Outside of Everwinter on the opposite side of the silver mine. Currently abondoned. 

The townsfolk of Everwinter can't remember the last time people lived in the mining town. Now any minors reside in the town itself. Many rumors surround the old town. It could be haunted, it could be home to some foul beasts, the minors could have died in a mining accident or a curse plauged the minors, or the plague itself! No one really knows.
