Duergar talking beforehand:

"Get this BLOODY door open"

"I thought this was supposed to be a shite-DWARF *spits* house. Do shite-dwarves even have friends?"

"If we can't get this open soon I'm heading back to the caves."

"Fine fine, grab yer picks and start whackin lads, we're gonna be here a while."

Above the doorway is something written in common. It reads:

Only a true friend of the Dwarves at Kostha Merna will be allowed entry.

(Only an elf may open the door)

~inside

The doors open to a dark hallway. The hallway is about 20 feet wide and tall. You can't see the end from out here, and there doesn't appear to be any light inside.

As you enter the hallway the doors behind you slowly close, causing a breeze to blow past you. You're left in the pitch black besides your own light sources.

The walls are bare and there doesn't appear to be any side passages. There's only one direction to go.

As you continue to move along the hallway some sparkles catch your eyes about halfway up the walls. As you look closer you see that their are intricate inlaid pictures carved along the wall. 

They're made of silver.

The carving depicts a group of elves at the entrance to what looks like this cavern. They appear to be meeting with a group of dwarves (who are depicted with much more detail)

As you continue down the hallway you get a glimpse at another carving.

This one is a montage of various people at work. One one side dwarves are shown swinging pick axes and hammers. On the other side elves are shown weaving magic and song. In the middle of the carving are the two colliding, elf and dwarf side by side in a forge weaving magic with metal. There is more silver inlaid in this part of the scene than you've seen your lives, it almost appears to be glowing in the dark.
