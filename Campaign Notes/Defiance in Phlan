Session Notes:
    Session 1:
        Party introduced themselves
        Met Reese one of the halfing servers at the tea house
        Met the Harper but didn't learn anything about him other than he's an old half elf
        Successfully planted the magical pin on the sellers
        Killed the half orc, one thug escaped and one was captured and given to the harper**
        Blake and Jordan do most of the talking so try to find ways to force the others involvement (I made Nate the seller so he had to participate, and then Dani had to plant the pin when they decided to swap 

    Session 2:
        Party rescued the family and farmhands
        Mildrop used a crazy guiding bolt to nearly detroy the bugbear in one shot and the impressed the farmhands with a magic trick. His influence could potentially spread among farmhands throughout the country.
        
    Session 3:
        Party dealt with the various threats in the crypt. Everything went relatively according to plan. 
        Party was oerly cautious so it may be fun to get a timed threat idea going to keep them from carefully examining everything
