The premise:
    A king is holding a contest for groups of adventurers. The winners of the contest will have their choice of riches in either gold, honor (by joining the king's guard?), knowledge (access to the castle's library) or fame (by winning you'll basically become a celebrity). Maybe make it a holy contest too so that religious classes have incentive to participate. Of course, someting more sinister is happening behind the scenes.

    Narrative plot points:
        Call to the contest! - The contest is announced and the adventurers must travel to the location of the kingdom. Someone announces it at an inn all the heroes are at. (Have to do the monster scavenger hunt on their way to join?)

        First challenge to narrow down the many groups participating - monster hunter scavenger hunt? (Time limited?)

        Retrieve a magical item of great importance - King is using the contest to assemble a doomsday device.

        Solve riddle to find a secret location

        Fight versus the final group when there's only 1 other group left?

        King is either being manipulated or is himself evil, or the king is actually a good guy but the other group is using this contest to spread evil.
