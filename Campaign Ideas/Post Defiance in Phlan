An invasion of some sort of enemy happens at Phlan - the current homebase of the characters. The characters fight for as long as they can but eventually the call to retreat and abandon the city reaches them and they are forced to run. They travel all night to reach a more fortified town that becomes the new home base. Adventuring in and around Phlan can become a regular activity and NPCs previously met will reappear as refugees. 

The area around Phlan can tell it's own stories about the invastion. Who was it, why did they do it, and how can the adventurers retake Phlan one day to reclaim the homes of their favorite NPCs.
