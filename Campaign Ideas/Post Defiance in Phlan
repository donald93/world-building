An invasion of some sort of enemy happens at Phlan - the current homebase of the characters. The characters fight for as long as they can but eventually the call to retreat and abandon the city reaches them and they are forced to run. They travel all night to reach a more fortified town that becomes the new home base. Adventuring in and around Phlan can become a regular activity and NPCs previously met will reappear as refugees. 

The area around Phlan can tell it's own stories about the invastion. Who was it, why did they do it, and how can the adventurers retake Phlan one day to reclaim the homes of their favorite NPCs.


It should be heavily hinted or telegraphed that the invasion was caused by a group working behind the scenes in the various adventures the group has went on.

Once the party reaches the new city set up a few different narrative points to begin the west marches campaign. They should MOSTLY be contained adventures but I think having multiple branching paths sounds fun. The deeds of what the others have done should spread between all members of all the parties via notices the players right up post-session. 

*establish an adventuring hideout the first session in the new city as a sort of guild where the multiple adventuring parties meet up and exchange stories. It also can be a gold sink to rebuild certain parts of the building, hire staff, and do some business to become an adventuring guild. This could be an old abandoned mansion or inn. The players are somehow given the task of finding a missing artifact (possible mystery hook to start as well???) and end up finding the deed to the property. 

Hooks for the players:

- king is distracting the populace with a great gaming competition during war time
- actual war time activities, working with the guard and military to scout areas, take strategic outposts with the goal of retaking Phlan and learning more about the invaders
- a mystery of what happened to the old mansion/person who lived there/his rare artifact
- Maybe a dark underground that can be investigated and explored? A string of mysterious killings or attacks
