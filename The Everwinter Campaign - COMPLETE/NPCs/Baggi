Thoughts on Elleon:

    Excited about the opportunity for more work - especially on making and repairing the mining equipment. Feels like she may have to expand her shop if the work Elleon promises ends up happening. No reason to doubt him yet as his actions have only brought her money (he required her to work on ironwork he needed to build his manion. She also routinely is working on repairs and items for the men at arms he's hired)
