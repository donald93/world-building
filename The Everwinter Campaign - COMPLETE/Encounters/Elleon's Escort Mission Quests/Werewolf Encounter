The first night the party is south of the city they will be stalked by the werewolf pack.

There are two werewolves and a weretiger in the pack. 

The pack has been displaced from their usual hunting grounds in the eastern forest due to conflicts with a newly moved in spider family. Competing for food had been difficult and they lost a few members engaging with the nest, so they left.

Their main motivation is survival, but they're not illogical.

Through high persuasion roles and using some creative logic the party may be able to get the pack to leave. But the party is a juicy target and could feed the pack for days.

~The pack encountered the bandits that the party let go free
~Since this is their new home they are investigating what beat the bandits up so badly
~They're investigating danger 
~Tell the story about why they left thier old home in the forest
~Tiger is female and her name is Sybilla. Wolves are Jokkel and Talis.
~Why should they let them through

Near the end of the conversation:
    Sybilla's ears suddenly twitch and she turns around-
    Milldrop hears a noise as well

A dull but large sound reaches your ears. It's very far off, but it still manages to rumble the ground under your boots. 

The pack will attempt to leave quickly - probably going to hide. They give a warning that there are far worse things in this forest than them.
