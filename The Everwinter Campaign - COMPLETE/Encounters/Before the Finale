At some point the party will come accross the three teenagers they've run into before, Barry, Mel, and Hicks. They'll be playing with the Mace of Terror left behind by Wulfgar.


The two bloodblades Greta chatted with are helping to dispose of bodies and clean up the battlefield.


There is a small crowd gathered at the bottom of the the hill that leads to Elleon's house. It's a mixture of both Elleon's men and the townsfolk. Baggi and Vasili are both present. There are townsfolk who are outfitted in discarded armor and weapons from scavenged from the goblinoid army.The crowd is deciding what to do about Elleon. One of Elleon's men is angry, he speaks about the Dragon Elleon 'brought' to this village and how he watched his closest friends get incinerated. Some of the townsfolk are upset because Elleon has greatly disrupted their way of life - it was peaceful before, and simple. Everything got messy when Elleon showed up. 

Baggi and Vasili are undecided and trying to calm the crowd. They want more information, Elleon hasn't spoken with anyone since the attack. 

Baggi understands that her shop would be nothing without the money Elleon has brought in. She would have to go back to making horse shoes and nails for coppers and silver. 

Vasili is also undecided. He can see both sides. Elleon has invigorated this small, forgotten town but he did bring a lot of pain with him. 


Aralia will eventually attack the group with a hobgoblin captain, two hobgoblins, and a pair of goblins. They'll attempt to ambush the party during some downtime
