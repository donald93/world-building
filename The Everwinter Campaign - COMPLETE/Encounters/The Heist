Traps:

    Horkin's sanctum entrance:
        Sleep of Ages Trap
        XGE
        p114
        Simple trap (level 11â€“16, deadly threat)

        When a sleep of ages trap activates, a pressure plate unleashes a spell that threatens to send intruders into a deep slumber. The dungeon's guardians can then more easily dispose of the sleepers.
        Trigger.

        Stepping on the pressure plate triggers this trap.
        Effect.

        When activated, this trap casts a sleep spell centered on the pressure plate, using a 9th-level spell slot.
        Countermeasures.

        A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals the pressure plate. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check made within 5 feet of the pressure plate disables the trap, and a check with a total of 7 or lower triggers it. A successful dispel magic (DC 16) cast on the pressure plate destroys the trap.

Horkin's Sanctum:

    The stairs descend into darkness 

    You descend the stairs for nearly 10 minutes

    As you descend it gets warmer and warmer - as you reach the bottom you are becoming drenched in sweat. 

    There's a red glow at the end of the stairs


    A room opens at the base of the stairs. It's a large cavern, 60 x 60 feet with a high ceiling...100 ft?

    The far wall is a solid wall of lava pouring into a pool that encompasses 1/3rd the floor space

    The center of the room has a large circle of DRACONIC runes etched into it. At the four corners of the the circle are large pedastels. Three of them are currently occupied with large gems - red, blue, and green in color. They currently have a low, warm glow, and resonate with a failry quiet hum.

    The walls of the room are filled with shelves, spell components, 3k gp worth of gems, and some books. With an investigation of 15+? they can find an elven journal detailing the original convergence. 20+ They can also find the personal journal of Horkin as Sezyryn describing the details of his embedding at Elleon's company and his goals. 

    The runes:
        the runes describe what sounds like the elemental convergence. A joining of the four elemental planes into a single point and there are etches in the ground joining all four pedastels into the center of the circle. The runes also describe the ascendency of an individual to their 'true and final form'. A name is mentioned - Sezyryn, Prince of the Planes.

    As the runes are removed the room begins to shift and change. They were put into a sort of 'maintence mode' where they were keeping the portals at bay. The lava becomes unstable and starts to fill up the room. The lava will fill the cavern and close off the stairway.
