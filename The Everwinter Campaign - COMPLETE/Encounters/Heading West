A small group of advance hobgoblin forces have taken up a position in an abandoned gnoll camp

The party will be warned that something has been hunting livestock at the far edges of the town farmlands
    This will lead them to the old gnoll camp
    the farmers will comment on how this is different than before. It seemed organized, less slaughter and more like a hunting

The hobgoblin will talk to the party if possible. He'll at least lash out in warning of the oncoming forces. They have been summoned by a great evil to this land.
