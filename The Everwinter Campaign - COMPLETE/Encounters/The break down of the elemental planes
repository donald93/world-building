The barriers between the elemental planes and the material plane are breaking down centered around Everwinter. It began hundreds of years ago when the miners dug too greedily and caused a rip to form into the Earth elemental plane. This caused the mine to fill become inhabited by creatures that dwell on that plane. Altran knows how to mend the holes and will appear at the end of the dungeon to demonstrate and participate in the final fight.

--Barriers between the elemental planes and the material plane are breaking down
    Centered around Everwinter

--Each elemental plane has a portal somewhere in the area

--Players must discover where the final portal is to prevent a planar collapse
    Players will have to hunt down the various smaller portals to shut them to slow down the collapse

--Altran 
    Can feel a disturbance in planar energy and seeks it out when he hears about the adventurers entering the mine
    Can mend the smaller holes in the planes
    Will research where future holes will open and use them to triangulate where the final portal will become
    Will also research why this area is experiencing such a cosmic Everwinter

--Horkin
    Is trying to cause the planar collapse...maybe he's been coerced by a more powerful being?
    Is using his position to acquire the necessary components to do that - massive colored gems that can focus planar energy into a single position
