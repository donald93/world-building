You exit the keep onto a small balcony carved into the side of a cliff. There are stairs down to your right. In front of you is a spectacular view. A great lake nestled in the mountains. A small island in the middle glows faintly in the evening light. Henry's eyes are alight with wonder...for a moment. Then his knows turns up at the smell that hits you all. The lake lets off a putrid smell and part of it appears to be brown rather than the crisp blue of the rest. Nearby you see a rocky outcropping that leads closer to the tainted area.

The aboleth will make its presence known to everyone at this point if it hadn't already. It will still claim to be the lake tell the party that the portal they seek is within the tainted area or on the outcropping. Then it will attack and attempt to pull people into the lake. We'll test combat with it at this point.
