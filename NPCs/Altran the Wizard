Altran is an old human man. He owns and operates Altran's mystical emporium. He wears colorful robes and glasses. He has gray hair and an unkept beard. 

He's initially impressed with the party for solving his puzzles but is mostly excited about speaking to other wizards and mystical practioners.

He sells spellbooks and magical items. He will let the party know they're not quite ready to hanle his more...magical items. But if Loben is interested he can purchase a spellbook! 

He also is curious of they adventurers know of anywhere he could set up shop permantently. His tower can teleport around and he hasn't found a place to settle down yet. He is willing to settle in at Everwinter if the adventureres convince him. Otherwise he'll continue to appear randomly.
